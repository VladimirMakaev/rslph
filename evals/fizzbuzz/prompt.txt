Build a FizzBuzz command-line program.

The program should:
1. Read a number N from stdin
2. For each number from 1 to N (inclusive):
   - Print "Fizz" if divisible by 3
   - Print "Buzz" if divisible by 5
   - Print "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5
   - Otherwise print the number itself
3. Print each result on a separate line

Example:
Input: "15"
Output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

The program should handle positive integers. You may use any programming language.
